# NiktoRecon-Personal-Project-2-
In this personal project within my homelab I ran nikto against the target to see what information can be useful to gain access.

What did I do?
First I ran a Nikto scan against the target using the command "Nikto -h http://target IP" 

What did I do with the search results?
I plugged the webpages into firefox and began seeing what information I could use to potentially gain access.

What did the results of the search yield?
The results from the search gave me tons of information on vulnerabilities within the webpages of the target, to be honest most of which I didn't know how to make good use of as of right now.  However, as I continue to gain more experiece i'll learn how to make good use of it. I did end up finding the login credentials to the target and inights on what type of system the target was through something of a configuration file.

Comments
I plan on adding pictures so that my findings can be seen.

Skills learned?
Basic Nikto Scanning
Webpage Enumeration
